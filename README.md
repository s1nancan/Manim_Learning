# Manim_Learning

Many PhD dread over creating figures that can deliver the message in the most clear way. Especially trying to publish higher impact journals requires extra extra effort. Thickness of every line, size of every dot and even less then quarter of an inch empty space is questioned by your PI and you end up spending days trying to perfect every plot. That rigorous practice helped a lot in my transition to data science, plotting your results and creating a nicely flowing data story comes as a breeze. 

Then I saw videos from 3Blue1Brown... It made me question many visuals I create. I am not even mentioning all the fancy edited, highly Photoshopped videoes that are work of art but creating a simple rotating square... Given that any TikTok (ahem, I meant educational) videos are capturing audience, the importance of creating animations hit me different. Since then I was scared to even learn about any editing or animation tools, hey I am not an artist at all, but write programs for my livelihood. Oh boy, silly me.  

Long story short, I have discovered that 3Blue1Brown started a personal project to make the animation programmatic, reproducible, and fun to deliver his content: Manim. Now I am not only amazed by the complexity and flow of the videos also very happy to learn that his project is not only open to use, but also has a community around it. So I am starting to learn about Manim, thinking maybe I can create piece of content that will be not only fun, but useful for my data science job, given that I interact with business-folks all the time to deliver my message. 

I decided to share my journey of learning Manim, maybe few folks want to tag along. Isn't this whole social media thing about this.
